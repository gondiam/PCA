# Main exercise:

Given a soil microbiome dataset, to design and develop a model to determine the location of novel samples. 

        Take as input the file 1_taxa_counts.csv. Each cell is the abundance of one taxon in that sample

        Classify the samples without an assigned class in the 1_metadata.csv file. Additionally, you could also report the probability to belong to the predicted class. 

        Determine the most relevant taxa (i.e. otuids) to classify the samples

# PCA

Principal Componen Analysis (PCA) is used to determine the most relevant taxa in the variation dataset

# Neural Networks

We are going to use an artificial neural network for classification with the original variables
